The Story

I worked in tech for years mostly the IT Manager and Network Admin side. I transitioned out to freelance in Cloud Engineering and started doing more Web Development to give me more creative projects to work on.  This led to working other freelancers who were Software focused. I decided to make Software Engineering my full time job and am getting out of the freelance business to support my family.
