The Story

I worked in tech for years mostly the IT and Network Admin side.  Back in 2019 I got laid off when the company I was working for went under and was bought out.  I started freelancing as in Cloud Engineering and started doing more code to back up developers I work with.  I decided to make Software Engineering my full time job and am getting out of the freelance business to support my family.
